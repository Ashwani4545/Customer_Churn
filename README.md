🧠 Customer Churn Prediction
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. Churn prediction helps businesses identify customers likely to leave, enabling proactive retention strategies. The model is trained on historical customer behavior data and aims to classify whether a customer will churn or not.

📌 Problem Statement
Customer retention is crucial in competitive industries like telecom, banking, and SaaS. The goal of this project is to build a model that can:

Analyze customer attributes

Predict the likelihood of churn

Enable businesses to make informed retention decisions

📊 Dataset Overview
The dataset (churn.csv) includes various features such as:

CustomerID

Gender

Age

Tenure

Balance

Number of Products

Has Credit Card

Is Active Member

Estimated Salary

Exited (Target variable indicating churn: 1 = Yes, 0 = No)

Note: These features may vary slightly depending on the exact dataset used.

🚀 Key Features
Data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) using graphs and stats

Feature encoding and scaling

Model training with classification algorithms

Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.

Final prediction and conclusion

🛠️ Technologies Used
